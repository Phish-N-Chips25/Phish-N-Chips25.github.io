## Why we need an expert

Before kicking off the project, we made it a requirement to work with someone who has proven experience in cybersecurity. The goal is to ensure every decision—from defining use cases to assessing risks—stays aligned with market reality and mature security practices.

## Identifying and involving Daniel Marques

Our first step was finding a professional who could guide the team. We reached out to **Daniel Marques** from **Grupo Nabeiro**, who immediately showed interest in supporting our work. His background gives us a critical view of threats, governance models, and mitigation mechanisms.

## First meeting scheduled

After the initial conversation, Daniel confirmed his participation and we have already scheduled the first meeting:

- **Date:** 2 October 2025
- **Time:** 3:00 p.m.
- **Objective:** align expectations, clarify responsibilities, and validate the research plan.

## Collaborative meeting preparation

To make the most of the expert’s time, we are compiling a list of questions that covers four main areas:

1. **Domain context:** characterization of the main threats and trends he has observed recently.
2. **Project requirements:** validation of scope, success metrics, and technical constraints.
3. **Data and tooling:** recommendations for data sources and tooling we can explore throughout the semester.
4. **Collaboration roadmap:** cadence of checkpoints, feedback formats, and preferred communication channels.

Each team member is contributing questions and background material so that, on the day of the meeting, we can capture actionable insights.

## Next steps

- Finalize the question list by the end of September and share it with Daniel in advance.
- Document all answers and recommendations collected on 2 October, ensuring they remain accessible within our GitHub organization.
- Incorporate the expert’s feedback into project artifacts (backlog, test plan, acceptance criteria) right after the meeting.

With support from an expert like Daniel, we strengthen the project’s credibility and ensure our cybersecurity focus is guided by someone who faces these challenges every day.
