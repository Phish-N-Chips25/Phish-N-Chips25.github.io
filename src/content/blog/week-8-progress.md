## Week 8 Overview

Deadline week arrived. After the crunch in Week 7, we executed the final sequence of activities: **uploading every deliverable by 2 November**, presenting the implementation on **Monday, 3 November**, and delivering the **Demo Day pitch on 4 November**. This entry captures how those milestones played out and what we learned.

## Submission Marathon (due 2 November)

We delivered everything to Moodle and Challenges4Teams before the 23:59 cutoff:

- **Work deliverable** and **final article** uploaded to the discipline space, including appendices that document the Chrome extension user journey.
- **Pitch package** (slides + video) submitted to both UC spaces, ensuring consistent messaging between courses.
- **Challenges4Teams bundle** prepared with:
  - `COD-TEAM-10.zip`: full React front end, rule-engine services, Chrome extension source, and setup scripts.
  - `REL-TEAM-10.pdf`: final knowledge acquisition report, now cross-referenced with the Week 5 preliminary version.
- Double-checked checksums and added submission receipts to our shared drive for audit purposes.

## Implementation Presentations (3 November)

During the Monday session we walked classmates and faculty through the live stack:

- Demonstrated the **React interface** and the **Chrome extension** side-by-side, highlighting how both invoke Drools + Prolog.
- Showcased the decision trace so evaluators could see which rules triggered for each URL.
- Addressed questions about scalability, browser permissions, and the rationale for keeping a symbolic reasoning core.
- Gathered qualitative feedback that fed directly into our Demo Day pitch refinement.

## Demo Day Pitch (4 November)

The pitch focused on storytelling and differentiation:

- Broke the ice with “Good afternoon sharks, we’re here seeking 100K for 10% of our company” before jumping into the presentation, which immediately lightened the room.
- Structured the narrative around user pain (unsafe links), our dual-engine approach, and the transparency benefits of rule-based AI.
- Highlighted interoperability: the same backend serves the web app, extension, and future third-party integrations.
- Closed with the ENGCIA challenge submission status and roadmap for post-challenge enhancements.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Preparation beats improvisation**: rehearsals with the recorded pitch made the live sessions smoother.
2. **Consistent artifacts matter**: having the same terminology in the PDF report, slides, and demos reduced confusion during Q&A.
3. **Automation paid off**: the packaging scripts eliminated the risk of missing files in the ZIP submission.
4. **Extension parity**: evaluators appreciated that the Chrome extension mirrored the web experience, reinforcing the value of Week 7.

*Week 8 validated the full stack in front of stakeholders. With submissions complete and pitches delivered, we can now focus on polish, deployment pathways, and sharing what we learned with the broader MEIA community.*
